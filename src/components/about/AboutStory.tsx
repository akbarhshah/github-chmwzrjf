          FactFlow began as a simple idea in early 2024: to create a space where curiosity meets knowledge. 
          In a world overwhelmed with information, we saw the need for a platform that could deliver 
          fascinating, verified facts in an engaging and accessible way. What started as a passion project 
          quickly evolved into something much bigger.

        <p className="text-lg text-brand-700 dark:text-brand-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Our journey started with a small collection of carefully curated facts, each one meticulously 
          researched and verified. We believed that learning shouldn't be confined to classrooms or 
          textbooks – it should be an exciting journey of discovery that happens naturally, one 
          fascinating fact at a time. This belief drove us to develop an platform that makes learning 
          not just informative, but genuinely enjoyable.

        <p className="text-lg text-brand-700 dark:text-brand-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          What sets FactFlow apart is our commitment to both accuracy and engagement. Every fact in our 
          database goes through a rigorous verification process, drawing from reputable scientific journals, 
          academic institutions, and expert sources. But we don't stop at verification – we believe that 
          how information is presented is just as important as its accuracy. That's why we craft each fact 
          and its explanation with care, ensuring it's not just educational, but captivating.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-brand-700 dark:text-brand-300 leading-relaxed">
          Today, FactFlow serves as a bridge between casual curiosity and deeper understanding. Whether 
          you're a student, professional, or simply someone who loves learning, our platform offers a 
          daily dose of knowledge that sparks curiosity and encourages further exploration. We're proud 
          to be part of your learning journey, one fascinating fact at a time, and we're excited to 
          continue growing and evolving with our community of knowledge seekers.
